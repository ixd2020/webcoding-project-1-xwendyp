        <h1 class="textaligncenter">About</h1>
        <p class="textaligncenter">John La Farge studied law and received a master degree. The legal profession did not appeal to him and began to study art as his twenty-first birthday present. La Farge is one of the first few western artists to become interested in Japanese art. Not only that he is also a modernist drive to experiment with materials and to explore space and time, roaming across global cultures and past eras. Despite having many accomplishments, he was not a successful businessman, as he faced several bankruptcies in his career.

                John La Farge
            </h2>
            <p>
                John La Farge was born in New York City, the son of wealthy French emigrants, his father having been a refugee from the ill-fated Napoleonic expedition to San Domingo. La Farge started drawing at an early age and graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount St. Mary's College in Maryland. He went to Europe in 1856, worked briefly in Paris under the painter Thomas Couture, and travelled through northern Europe. He returned to Newport, the United States, to study with William Morris Hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is one of the first American artists to import and be inspired by Japanese colour prints (1863). With Henry Adams, he made a trip to Japan in 1886, later publishing An Artist's Letters from Japan (1897).

                La Farge received his first large-scale commission in 1876. In Copley Square, Boston, he completed an entire complex of mural decorations for Richardson's distinguished Trinity Church.

            <p>
                La Farge worked out a way to produce opalescent glass and had several commissions for stained glass windows from churches and private patrons. La farge had several major commission and continued painting and accepting commissions for mural work. Perhaps the best-known mural is the great apse mural of the Ascension of Christ in the Church of the Ascension in New York City, completed in 1887.
